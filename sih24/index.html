                Smart India Hackathon (SIH) is a nationwide competition where students from all over India come
                together to solve real-world problems faced by different government departments and industries.
                It&#39;s a platform for students to use their technical skills and creativity to find innovative
                solutions to
                important challenges. Winning teams may have their solutions implemented on a larger scale,
                making a positive impact on society. SIH promotes innovation, teamwork, and problem-solving
                among Indian students. Smart India Hackathon is a nationwide initiative to provide students with a
                platform to solve some of the pressing problems we face in our daily lives, and thus inculcate a
                culture of product innovation and a mindset of problem-solving. The first four editions SIh3017,
                SIh3018, SIh3019, SIh3020 and SIh3022 proved to be extremely successful in promoting innovation
                out-of-the-box thinking in young minds, especially engineering students from across India.
